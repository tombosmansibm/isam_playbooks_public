Some public playbooks for ISAM deployments using Ansible

You need to use these in conjunction with the IBM Security repositories related to Ansible deployments for ISAM.

The ISAM Ansible Modules:

You can copy the directory into your playbook directory .
The plays will need to be adapted to your variables !

This is provided as-is , without any support or warranty, although you are free to contribute.
